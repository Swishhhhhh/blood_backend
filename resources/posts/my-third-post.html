<p>Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances
    such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.[1]
    Blood in the circulatory system is also known as peripheral blood, and the blood cells it carries, peripheral blood
    cells.
